# Real Time Bus Tracker

Tracks a bus route between MIT and Harvard. We were tasked to make some changes, and as suggested, I changed some styles around from what was given in the starter code.

## Disclaimer/How it Works

Any comment prefaced by an asterisk (*) are notes I have added and not part of the curriculum

I don't know everything. I'm new to coding.
It helps me in the moment and also when coming back later to write detailed comments.

I'm taking this to the next level in this bootcamp so that I can attempt to make more sense of a vague and ambiguous curriculum.
It's hard to learn coding without vocabulary or lists of covered material

I'm adding some vocab here to supplement the lack of resources given in the MITxPro Emeritus Codio assignment.

I'm glad I have the time and enough previous coding knowledge to break down each piece of this assignment.

Feel free to reach out if you spot something super incorrect. I want to learn and grow

## Future Dev

Find a completely different API I actually care about. Something interesting.

## Resources

Shoutout to the recorded videos because it was all starter code. They also simply give us the Solution File, so.. shoutout to the Solution File as well, I suppose
