It helps me in the moment and also when coming back later to write detailed comments.

I'm taking this to the next level in this bootcamp so that I can attempt to make more sense of a whole lot of new information. I guess this is kinda like my own kind of flashcards. Very cool!

I'm adding some vocab here to supplement the lack of resources given in the MITxPro Emeritus Codio assignment.

I'm glad I have the time and enough previous coding knowledge to break down each piece of this assignment.

Feel free to reach out if you spot something super incorrect. I want to learn and grow
